Depends: boot, MASS, R (>= 2.4.0)
Description: The package provides various statistical methods for
  designing and analyzing randomized experiments. One main functionality
  of the package is the implementation of randomized-block and
  matched-pair designs based on possibly multivariate pre-treatment
  covariates. The package also provides the tools to analyze various
  randomized experiments including cluster randomized experiments,
  randomized experiments with noncompliance, and randomized experiments
  with missing data.
